# About this Manning lifeProject

Red Records is a music label that got famous with the vinyl comeback. It operates in both the United States and the United Kingdom with offices in New York and in London. In this liveProject, you’ll step into the role of a Frontend Tech Lead for Red Records and solve an organizational and technological challenge using micro frontends.

During the last all-hands, the CEO announced the new music streaming service that the company will release in less than six months. The project is not on track and while the backend is almost there, the two frontend teams, located in New York and London, are struggling to cooperate for delivering. The time zone difference gives them just a few hours together each day and they’re spending all the time arguing about which state management library they should use or if React is better than Vue.js. The leadership team is asking you to come up with a solution for the problem and also to lay the groundwork for the implementation.

Your work is crucial to deliver the new streaming service. The two teams should be able to work independently, in parallel, reducing cross-team communication to the bare minimum.
